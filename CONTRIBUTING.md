# Contributing to Spot

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Spot! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this open-source price action analysis tool.

## üéØ Project Vision

Spot aims to democratize price action analysis for cryptocurrency traders by providing:
- Professional-grade mathematical analysis
- Clean, maintainable code architecture
- Educational value for the trading community
- Open-source accessibility for all traders

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Flutter 3.8+ installed
- Dart 3.0+
- Git
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions

### Getting Started
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/richardggarcia/spot.git`
3. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
4. Verify setup: `flutter analyze` (should show zero issues)
5. Run the app: `flutter run`

## üìã Code Standards

### Architecture Guidelines
- **Maintain Hexagonal Architecture**: Keep domain logic pure and independent
- **Follow SOLID principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, etc.
- **Use dependency injection**: Register services through GetIt
- **Implement proper error handling**: No silent failures

### Code Style
- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comprehensive documentation for public APIs
- Maintain consistent formatting with `dart format`

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for domain logic
- Add widget tests for UI components
- Ensure `flutter test` passes
- Maintain or improve code coverage

## üîÑ Contribution Process

- **Screenshots**: For UI changes, include before/after images
- **Tests**: Include relevant test cases
- **Documentation**: Update README or docs if needed

## üéØ Priority Areas for Contribution

### High Priority
- **Exchange Integrations**: Additional APIs (Binance, Coinbase, etc.)
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Weekly/monthly trend implementation
- **Error Handling**: Improved user experience for API failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory usage and speed improvements

### Medium Priority
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Better visual design and user experience
- **Additional Cryptocurrencies**: Support for more trading pairs

- **Testing**: Unit tests, widget tests, integration tests
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, better contrast ratios
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages

## üêõ Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:
- **Clear description** of the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** the problem
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Environment details** (Flutter version, device, OS)
- **Screenshots or logs** if applicable

Use this template:
```markdown
**Bug Description**
A clear description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. See error

**Expected Behavior**
What should happen instead.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots.

**Environment**
- Flutter version: [e.g. 3.8.0]
- Device: [e.g. iPhone 12, Pixel 6]
- OS: [e.g. iOS 16, Android 13]
```

## üí° Feature Requests

For new features:
1. **Check existing discussions** to avoid duplicates
2. **Describe the use case** clearly
3. **Explain the trading benefit** 
4. **Consider implementation complexity**
5. **Propose API or UI changes** if relevant

## üîß Technical Guidelines

### Hexagonal Architecture Layers
```
üé® Presentation: UI components, BLoC, user interactions
üèõÔ∏è Domain: Business logic, entities, use cases (pure Dart)
üîß Infrastructure: APIs, databases, external services
```

### Domain Layer Rules
- **No Flutter dependencies**: Keep domain logic pure Dart
- **No external API details**: Use abstract interfaces (ports)
- **Business logic only**: Mathematical calculations, trading rules
- **Immutable entities**: Use copyWith for updates

### Testing Strategy
- **Domain**: 100% unit test coverage for business logic
- **Infrastructure**: Mock external dependencies
- **Presentation**: Widget tests for UI components
- **Integration**: End-to-end user workflows
